WEEK 3 - QUESTIONS
  What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read? --- I read that there was a reliance on patience through using different web pages and audience participation to progress the story.
  How are those elements meaningful? --- These elements added a sense of immersion along with suspence, along with the impression that the player had control in the story's ending instead of playing a predetermined narrative.
  How are the works read differently from print literature? --- Print literature is based around predetermination and control of the speed of the narrative, which are at odds from the elements observed in the works.
  How is electronic literature different from print literature? --- Electronic literature utilises unconventional narrative flow and pace to tell stories, along with encouraging electronic interaction and consumation of narratives.
  What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature? --- The qualities of these works that correspond with the qualities of electronic literature are interaction, unconventionality, meditation on themes through narrative speeds, and digital creativity.
