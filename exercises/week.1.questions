WEEK 1 - QUESTIONS 

What do you think digital writing is?
--- I think digital writing is a narrative that is conveyed through a digital format. 

What do you expect from the digital writing lab? 
--- I expect to learn from the digital writing lab how to write specifically for a digital format and audience, and how the subgenre of online literature has been formed.

What types of writing do you do? 
--- I write mainly fiction prose while occasionally dabbling in screenwriting. I prefer genre fiction over contemporary realism in my writing. 

What tools (or techniques) so you use to write? 
--- I use visual inspiration, such as Pinterest boards, as an initial tool for ideas, before employing further research of my chosen topic or setting throughout my process.

How do these tools shape the way you write? 
--- These tools help me visualise a story and form I would like it to take, however it is common for me to become overwhelmed with possibilities that the inspiration gives and find it hard to write anything at all.
